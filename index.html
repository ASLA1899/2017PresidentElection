I can’t begin to convey to you how honored I am to stand as a candidate for President-Elect of the American Society of Landscape Architects.  If I am elected I am going to devote myself to increasing the visibility of landscape architects, helping to create opportunities for all of us to do the good work we are uniquely trained and qualified to do. <br /><br />      

I’ll be brief about my experience with the ASLA that qualifies me to serve as your president.  I have been very actively involved in the Society at both the chapter and national levels for nearly 30 years, and was both surprised and ecstatic when awarded the President’s Medal in Denver last fall, an acknowledgement of my long-term active dedication to the Society.<br /><br />

After 40 years in private practice as a landscape architect, 30 of them in Virginia, I made some big changes in the past year.  I took a break from making money through my work and moved to Seattle to live near my children and two young grandsons.  Some might call this retirement, but I look at it as a time to listen to and learn from the next generations; to volunteer and advocate; to enjoy a different and very exciting environment; to read, walk and think.  When you are over 65 and belong to the International Living Future Institute, you become an Elder Member for being “wiser”.  I hope this is true – I seek to become more informed and wiser as the years pass.<br /><br />

My recent reading and study has included several concepts that particularly resonate with me relative to the ASLA and the profession: resilience, stewardship, and the commons.  These are not new concepts, but they remain essential to our practice, and we discover more about them all the time.<br /><br />
<b>RESILIENCE</b><br /><br />
We are reaching a time of environmental and ecological crisis as the carrying capacity of the globe is challenged and negative human impacts are increasingly irreversible.   Although many of us have anticipated extreme changes in the global natural and social environment, societies have demonstrated limited will or capacity to identify and act upon appropriate responses.  Landscape architects are uniquely suited to help address many of the imbalances in the world, and I believe we will increasingly find the opportunities to work as change agents, helping communities become healthier and more resilient.  And by communities, I mean humans, plants, animals, water, air, soil - the whole works.<br /><br />

The need for nature in a healthy human life has been brought to the forefront of public awareness.  Our focus has often been on active recreation, but the effect of nature on our psyche is just as significant.  We are increasingly recognizing this in health care design and playground design.  The Japanese have coined a phrase for spending time in nature - shinrin-yoku – translated as something like “forest bathing”, since research has proven that just spending time walking in nature has a positive effect on the immune system.<br /><br />

Creating resilient and healthy communities, however, is not just an issue of physical design.  A resilient community must have strong social and cultural ties, a common sense of belonging.  We need to help people, working together, facilitating the necessary process to help people form the public spaces they need for community building and interaction. Self-determination and involvement are necessary components to resilience, and are keys to each individual’s sense of ecological responsibility.  The new Environmental Justice PPN is, I believe, a reflection of our increased understanding of the significance of this need in the work we do, and I am excited to participate in and see what emerges from this network.  We must have justice, working together to be resilient.<br /><br />

<b>STEWARDSHIP</b><br /><br />
Each morning as I walk down the stairs, I face a poster created by Hundertwasser, the visionary Austrian artist and architect.  It is a strong graphic that includes a phrase that is good guidance for living: “You are a guest of nature.  Behave.”  I have been reading and thinking about how we can better care for our common wealth, reinvigorating our public sense of stewardship for the environment, protecting natural resources for present needs and future generations. <br /><br />

The phrase, “think globally, act locally” also comes back to me with increasing frequency.  The use of this phase from the latter half of the 20th century has come to represent many things, but I think it really does apply particularly to landscape architects, as we work both with the large environmental systems and the very particular local ecological character of our sites.   The particular geography of a place is intricately tied up with the culture of the people, plants and animals that live there and use it.  This local understanding is essential to our practice.  The ASLA vision includes stewardship, and as an organization as well as individuals in our various communities, we must act not only with our locality in mind, but also with a global perspective.  So many things that are of primary concern to landscape architects, and that create present and future work for our practitioners, affect us locally but are related to climate change on global scale.  And climate change is being recognized as the greatest threat to economic and political global balance.<br /><br />

I believe that an increased focus on how the ASLA works with the global community can also help address our pressing issue with the lack of diversity in the profession.  I believe our emphasis on developing more diverse practitioners is one of the most important things we are doing.  While we grow our network within the United States through our diversity summits, we also need to grow our network internationally.  The declaration of the World Landscape Architecture Month in which we find ourselves is a step in the right direction, as is our support of the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles.<br /><br /> 

<b>THE COMMONS</b><br /><br />
We are used to thinking of the physical commons – oceans, air, public lands, but our understanding of the commons is broadening.  There is a burgeoning movement towards information sharing and open sourcing.   Younger people across the globe are working together via the worldwide web and in local groups to not only share ideas, but to create new ways of doing things as well as new materials and objects that can help solve community problems.   Groups like Open Source Ecology, which is working to create sharable and changeable equipment and machines, and OHANDA, the Open Source Hardware and Design Alliance, are part of the growing digital commons, working to increase both collaboration and innovation.<br /><br />
I believe this open design is going to radically change how things are accomplished in the future.  It is important that the ASLA keeps on the path of working within new social structures and with new media to be part of this changing approach and consciousness.  It is undoubtedly going to affect the ways in which younger practitioners relate to each other and how they determine if ASLA membership is of value to them.  It necessitates transparency and openness.  It includes a changed attitude towards ownership.
<br /><br />
<b>REAL VALUE</b><br /><br />
More and more people, the kinds of people that will lead the profession in the future, are looking less for dollar value and more for meaning.  The Society must be meaningful to be effective.
We are stronger than many of the other professional societies, in spite of our smaller size, because we have consistently created greater and greater value for members, not just through providing more “things” but through providing a source for information, a forum for idea exchange, and tools to enhance our practice.  The value of membership truly is the strength we gain by working together.  The Society must remain creative, responsive to the ever-changing needs of the members and of the profession as a whole.<br /><br />I really appreciate our recently revised mission statement, and if I may slightly paraphrase it:  in order to advance landscape architecture as a profession, we need to consistently and nimbly advocate, communicate, educate, and provide fellowship as a community of individuals who are passionate about the stewardship of our common wealth - our built and natural environments.

This is a time like never before to be a Landscape Architect. I have heard this said many times, and now, upon reflection, it was probably true each time. That is the mark of a growing, improving, organization with a positive trajectory. This is the time when we are gaining support and recognition for the value of our work and for our perspectives like never before. Our time is arriving, and not without notice. Our next opportunities are going to be better than ever before.<br /><br />

This past January twenty third I was included in the group of ASLA Executive Committee members invited by the White House to meet with the President’s Council on Environmental Quality. This was a momentous time in the history of our Profession. This was a big deal. We, the Landscape Architects, were, quite literally, at the table. And it was by their invitation. We are gaining ground and we are not going back. This is the time when we are being sought out to speak and give input on how we can turn this environmental turmoil around. For some of you this represents a lifetime of work to become recognized: thank you.  For some of you who are newer to the profession, first, welcome, and second, this is your future. It does not stop here, and we cannot retreat from this point. Together we must continue this work to benefit both nature and the humans who live within her. This becomes the time when our work will be more obvious and appreciated. But we must make it so, and never rely on the past work to do this important task. Our everyday efforts are theory applied, and on purpose.<br /><br />

This recognition was not by chance or without the hard work of our blue ribbon staff in Washington. The efforts made on our behalf are part of the reason we are gaining ground and becoming recognized for our work. But we cannot rely on them alone. Each of us must make sure we write the press releases that discuss our latest project. We need to be vocal and visible. This is not just done by our national association for us, but with their work, we can do much to advance the name and profession. And, at the same time, preserve and repair this world as only Landscape Architects are able. <br /><br />

Our educators are challenged to fill the seats in classroom and studio. You have my commitment to continue the good work already begun to get landscape architecture recognized as a STEM discipline. The prominence and respect this will bring is only matched by the visibility to students eager to make a difference. We will also gain important inroads to better opportunities for grants through the National Science Foundation, which is central to the decision making for STEM professional designation. We need to pursue this means to a better end for our profession. With that recognition we will begin to be respected for the work we already do as part of our practices. We will have better chances to make the difference our planet so desperately needs.<br /><br />

The drawings have begun for our new Center for Landscape Architecture in Washington, DC. The Board of Trustees approved this landmark action at the annual meeting in Denver this past November. This allows the ASLA to remodel the existing building we own in Washington and turn it into a Center for meetings, interactions with legislators and design professionals, and the public. Activity will fill the structure with light and energy that we have only seen hinted at prior to this time. The energy is there, and the work will have a great return on the investment. The heightened visibility of this project and the proposed green street just outside the doors will further enhance our profession as doing the work that others only suggest. We are doing that on a daily basis, so why not now and at our Headquarters?<br /><br />

We are just coming down from the high of the extremely successful annual meeting in Denver. The education sessions, registration and Expo were among the best ever in our history. This in a recovering economy is a great victory. We must remain committed to our members by providing the member services and annual meeting and expo we deserve and request. Each of the past three years has been better than the last. Each has proven that the bar can be advanced and we can meet the expectations of our membership. I am committed to advancing the profession through the effectiveness of each meeting as we move forward. It is, indeed, a time like never before to be a landscape architect.<br /><br />

ASLA must remain relevant and important to the membership we serve. Further, we must expand that membership in order to provide more services and opportunities. The members of our organization represent just over forty percent of all those practicing our profession. We, the forty percent, are responsible for licensure or registration advocating for health, safety, and welfare standards in all states of the union. Our membership is responsible for the legislation that shapes tomorrow’s practice. ASLA members are responsible for bringing us to the table at the request of the White House this past January. Sixty percent of landscape architecture practitioners are realizing benefit from our voluntary efforts and our financial commitment. This sixty percent should become members of the American Society of Landscape Architects. It is incumbent on our Chapters to make this obvious to the existing members, and to show the value of membership to those who do not belong. It is time to make the benefit to our members more obvious and palpable. Whether through professional development hour pricing and availability, perks, or other benefits, we members need to feel that we are valued for our work and support. Much is already in place that does just that. More will be coming.<br /><br />

This is the time to come to the table with your concerns and issues. We all enjoy many choices in the course of any given day. We all have concerns and issues with any number of things. We can choose to simply live with the issues as is, and become (or remain) a grumpy, unhappy Landscape Architect. Or, we can choose to make our voice heard. In this organization that means becoming vocal and following through. I know this well, as, at one point I too, was that grumpy, grumbling Landscape Architect. I realized that was going nowhere really fast, so I chose to make my voice heard. Look where that got me. When we were sitting at the White House Committee offices in Washington, DC, I spoke my part, and people listened. You have that choice. I do not sponsor membership in an organization that does not allow questions or tolerate divergent opinions. As the sole professional organization to support our profession the ASLA has the mandate to accept members and hear their thoughts. We must address the faults and pitfalls to avoid failure. We need your voice. Together we can forge a strong membership and then an association which will be our advocate. This is the ASLA that will propel us into the successful next hundred years. We must listen, consider, and advance. Make your voice heard. All of our members’ voices must be heard and valued. We must be intolerant of barriers to leadership or practice for our membership.<br /><br />

I recently spoke to the Wisconsin Chapter of the American Institute of Architects at their fall meeting. The daylong event was concerning the topic of water. I was the last speaker of the day. The first speaker was a tribal elder from an Ojibwa nation in northern Wisconsin. I knew him from work I had done with both University Extension and my firm on that reservation. His last slide was an image of an Ojibwa youth, clad in tribal regalia for the annual Pow Wow. The smile on that young boys face was broad and beautiful. He was my elder friend’s grandson. The talk continued as he related that the Ojibwa had entered into treaty and land rights agreements with our government when the land was still very pristine. It is common now, as then, that the Ojibwa consider any decision with how the outcome will affect the seventh generation hence. When these original land granting treaties and consideration began the land was robust and healthy, the air clean and sweet, and game was abundant. Now there are many seasons when they cannot eat the local fish. The rains come faster and more intensely than ever before. The soils are challenged to yield crops. The smiling grandson in my friend’s picture is the seventh generation after the treaty signing. It is our obligation and duty, as Landscape Architects, to do our work with the utmost care and conviction that we can turn this around. We are responsible for the land and fitting humans to it. You have my commitment to make our voice heard. Please join with me in making that voice heard in every state and in our nation’s Capitol.<br /><br />

I consider it an honor to be speaking with you in the company of Vaughn Rinner. Vaughn and I have shared stories for some time as leaders in this excellent organization. I am pleased to consider her my friend.<br /><br />

Thank you to the Nominating Committee, the Executive Committee, and our leadership for allowing me this opportunity to run for your President Elect. I must thank my wife, Barbara, to whom I cannot give enough credit for this opportunity; to my children, Alison (MLA 2010), Evan, and Parker, for the time they have allowed me to be engaged in this profession, and the commitment that went with that decision. And thank you for this opportunity to, once again, make my voice heard by those I respect.</p></div></div></div>
